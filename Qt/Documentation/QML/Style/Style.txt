Note: The macOS and Windows styles are not suitable for customizing. 
It is instead recommended to always base a customized control on top of a 
single style that is available on all platforms, 
e.g Basic Style, Fusion Style, Imagine Style, Material Style, Universal Style.
 By doing so, you are guaranteed that it will always look the same, 
 regardless of which style the application is run with.
 To learn how to use a different style, see Using Styles in Qt Quick Controls. 
Alternatively, you can create your own style.


Style:
	macOS
	Windows
	Basic
	Fusion
	Imagine
	Material
	Universal
